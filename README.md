# Bike-Buyers-Data-Analysis-Project
Excel &amp; Data Analytics Project

## Executive Summary
### Business Problem:
A retail company selling bikes wants to understand the key factors influencing bike purchases.
They have a dataset of customer demographics, income, commute distance, and lifestyle attributes but lack clear insights into who their target customers are and how to improve bike sales.

### Solution:
Performed a full data analysis in Excel — from data cleaning and exploration to building an interactive dashboard that visualizes customer profiles, regional performance, and purchase patterns.
The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly identify the ideal customer profile (ICP) and make data-driven marketing decisions.

### Impact:

- Improved understanding of customer demographics by visualizing key buying patterns.

- Identified regions and customer groups with the highest purchase potential.

- Built a reusable Excel dashboard template that updates automatically with new data.

### Next Steps:

- Extend the project using SQL or Python for deeper analysis.

- Build a Power BI / Tableau version for dynamic business reporting.

## Business Problem

The company has observed fluctuating sales performance across regions and demographics.
Management needs answers to questions such as:

- Who is more likely to buy a bike — by gender, income, age, or region?

- How does car ownership or commute distance affect bike purchases?

- What is the average income and age of bike buyers vs. non-buyers?

- Which regions or customer types should be targeted for better sales?

Without this knowledge, marketing campaigns and sales strategies remain broad and inefficient.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

- Source: “Bike Buyers Dataset” (provided as an Excel file).

- Contains demographic, lifestyle, and purchasing information.

### Data Cleaning

- Removed duplicates and standardized text fields.

- Fixed categorical inconsistencies (“M/F”, “Yes/No”).

- Verified numeric columns (Income, Age, Cars).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed trends using Excel formulas, filters, and PivotTables.

- Visualized insights using Pie, Bar, Column, and Line charts.

- Built Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for total customers, purchase rate, and averages.

### Dashboard Design

- Blue–Green professional theme for business readability.

- Interactive slicers for filtering by Gender, Region, and Education.

- KPI Cards + Charts:

Pie: Purchase % Overall

Bar: Purchases by Region

Column: Purchases by Education or Gender

Line: Cars vs. Purchase %
